# Kipfian

day 2 scrum:

What I did:

1. loaded into MongoDB
2. finished EDA
3. finished naive base model

Roadblock:

1. feature engineering with multi-level features
2. find an efficient way to try models with more and more data

Planning to do:

1. Add text features


##To-do
### Day 1
- [x] Store the data / combine files / take a sample
    - [x] Load all data into MongoDB
    - [x] Sample part of the data according to lenders
- [x] EDA, log every question to be answered
    - [x] Univariate
    - [x] Multi-variate
    - [x] How about the number of loans of each lender?
    - [x] How about the number of lenders of each loan?

### Day 2
- [ ] Finish iter 0: naive rec sys base model with Dato
- [ ] Finish iter 1: Add tfidf of text fields

### Day 3 ~ 5
- [ ] Finish iter 3 to n: try other features

### Day 6
- [ ] Try image processing with [this](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/deepimagesent/?hn)

### Day 7
- [ ] Create a working prototype of the app

### Day 8
- [ ] Add visual effect
