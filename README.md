day 4 scrum:

What I did:

1. resesarch and read the paper on factorization machine and switch the focus from implementing complex algorithm to feature engineering + using graphlab module

Roadblock:

1. the performance getting data from mongodb
2. the performance training the model

Planning to do:

1. get rid of duplicates in data
2. successfully run the first model with side features added
3. improve the performance of getting data from mongodb




##To-do
### Day 1
- [x] Store the data / combine files / take a sample
    - [x] Load all data into MongoDB
    - [x] Sample part of the data according to lenders
- [x] EDA, log every question to be answered
    - [x] Univariate
    - [x] Multi-variate
    - [x] How about the number of loans of each lender?
    - [x] How about the number of lenders of each loan?

### Day 2
- [x] Finish iter 0: naive rec sys base model with Dato
- [x] Finish iter 1: use Dato's factorization recommender

### Day 3
- [x] Understand ranking factorization machine
- [ ] Finish iter 3: add naive features as side features (date, month, year lended)
- [ ] Research on how to train the model on new loans and new users in graphlab

### Day 4
- [ ] Drop duplicates in mongodb
- [ ] Finish iter n: add text-related features

### Day 5
- [ ] Finish iter n: 

### Day 6
- [ ] Try image processing with [this](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/deepimagesent/?hn)

### Day 7
- [ ] Create a working prototype of the app

### Day 8
- [ ] Add visual effect
