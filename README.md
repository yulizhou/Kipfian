day 3 scrum:

What I did:

1. created two recommebers with graphlab

Roadblock:

1. need to learn ways to improve performance
2. what features to add

Planning to do:

1. get on the right path and add features
2. try SVD or other methods to improve performance



Three ways to proceed:

1. improve current item-item rec sys
2. create a model to calculate a score/likelihood and feed into a rec sys as 'rating'
3. use factorization recommender to find latent features and explain


final product:
a rec sys




##To-do
### Day 1
- [x] Store the data / combine files / take a sample
    - [x] Load all data into MongoDB
    - [x] Sample part of the data according to lenders
- [x] EDA, log every question to be answered
    - [x] Univariate
    - [x] Multi-variate
    - [x] How about the number of loans of each lender?
    - [x] How about the number of lenders of each loan?

### Day 2
- [x] Finish iter 0: naive rec sys base model with Dato
- [x] Finish iter 1: use Dato's factorization recommender

### Day 3
- [ ] Improve the base model to be functioning
- [ ] Finish iter 3: add features and try SVD

### Day 4
- [ ] Finish iter n: 

### Day 5
- [ ] Finish iter n: 

### Day 6
- [ ] Try image processing with [this](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/deepimagesent/?hn)

### Day 7
- [ ] Create a working prototype of the app

### Day 8
- [ ] Add visual effect
